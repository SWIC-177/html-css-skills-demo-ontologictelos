# TODO

- Update html form's
  - Add a first name, last name, email, and phone number form.
- 'Select' all of the input fields.
- 'Select' the submit button.
- Add event listeners to each input field, such that
- upon losing focus (`blur` event) on the input fields, we will
- show the error. For now, we are not validating the input fields.
