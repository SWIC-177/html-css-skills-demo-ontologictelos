    <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p> 
        The question of who and what i am is always looming in my head. 
        I've found that the brain is no different than a muscle, a different thing but works under the same principles. 
        To answer questions of who and what my own brain needs to be worked out but not in the same way as my bicep. In comes philosophy and psychology.
        I try to continually ask myself harder questions and come to a better understanding of the most basic premises of what we believe.

        Upon learning more about philosophy the question of theology became necessary to answer. 
        Is there a God in all this became a crucial point of investigation. Eventually after reading Soren Kierkegaard, I found the question itself is laughable.
        Soren posits the idea that God is not a premise to be known but a being to be experienced. In this way he aligns himself with socrates in that truth is
        not something intellectual but something more akin to an experienced based phenomena.

        What does all this have to do with me though? Ultimately, I am just a being looking to understand myself better and in my own conclusions know 
        the God that made me. In these investigations ive gained a love for the investigative nature of philosophy and psychology. Ive grown to appreciate 
        the arts and expressions of the human experience, of which i partake and share my history with. Programming is just the same thing as innovations such 
        as the radio, the airplane, the phone. A technological innovation that builds upon the united mental might of the historical past and the current brain power.
        continually self actualizing ourselves, sharing our own experience and creative power to create cool and beautiful things that share our own being with others.
