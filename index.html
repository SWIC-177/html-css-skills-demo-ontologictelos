    <p class="pl-60 pr-60 text-left">
      I find complex things interesting and fun to investigate thus the question
      of who and what i am is always looming in my head. While asking these
      questions doesn't make me any money coding seems like a fun way to make
      some while also dealing with complex ideas and problems. In any case, I've
      found that the brain is no different than a muscle, a different thing but
      works under the same principles. To answer questions of who and what my
      own brain needs to be worked out but not in the same way as my bicep. In
      comes philosophy and psychology. I try to continually ask myself harder
      questions and come to a better understanding of the most basic premises of
      what we believe.

      Upon learning more about philosophy the question of theology became
      necessary to answer. Is there a God in all this became a crucial point of
      investigation. Eventually after reading Soren Kierkegaard, I found the
      question itself is laughable. Soren posits the idea that God is not a
      premise to be known but a being to be experienced. In this way he aligns
      himself with socrates in that truth is not something intellectual but
      something more akin to an experienced based phenomena.
    </p>
    <p class="pb-10 pl-60 pr-60 pt-10 text-left">
      What does all this have to do with me though? Ultimately, I am just a
      being looking to understand myself better and in my own conclusions know
      the God that made me. In these investigations ive gained a love for the
      investigative nature of philosophy and psychology. Ive grown to appreciate
      the arts and expressions of the human experience, of which i partake and
      share my history with. Programming is just the same thing as innovations
      such as the radio, the airplane, the phone. A technological innovation
      that builds upon the united mental might of the historical past and the
      current brain power. continually self actualizing ourselves, sharing our
      own experience and creative power to create cool and beautiful things that
      share our own being with others.

      I also love everything about coffee. Coffee is a good drink even if made
      poorly. It is such a social drink as well, historically coffee shops have
      been in existence in some capacity sense it's inception just as some sort
      of social gathering place. When I have the time I really enjoy making my
      rounds to local coffee shops to see what innovative things they are doing
      with this beverage. Sump coffee in STL is probably my favorite shop in the
      area as they typically have a good varietal of coffee there and sometimes
      they will have a very rare varietal.
